# Hybrid Basic Communication Example
A lite project which demonstrates (in iOS) the basic communication between the web components and the native components in hybrid apps.

You can find here examples for:
- Code injection (Javascript) from native components to web components
- Method swizzling
- Cordova-Plugin-like so the web and native could talk (using the UIWebViewDelegate)
